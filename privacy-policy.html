    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="date"></span></p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the Video Downloader Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") 
        handles information when you use our extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent 
        about our practices.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong> The Video Downloader extension 
        operates entirely on your local device and does not send any data to external servers.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        The extension only accesses video elements and URLs on web pages you visit to enable the download functionality. 
        This information is processed locally in your browser and is never transmitted to us or any third party.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: Allows the extension to access the current tab to scan for videos when you click the "Scan Page" button.</li>
        <li><strong>downloads</strong>: Enables the extension to download video files to your device.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting</strong>: Allows the extension to inject scripts into web pages to detect video elements.</li>
        <li><strong>host_permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;)</strong>: Required to scan for videos on any website you visit. 
            This permission is necessary because videos can be hosted on any domain, and the extension needs to access 
            video URLs to enable downloads.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The extension does not store any data. All operations are performed in real-time when you interact with the extension. 
        No browsing history, video URLs, or any other information is saved or logged.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools. All functionality is self-contained 
        and operates entirely within your browser.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our extension does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children. Since we do not collect 
        any data, this is not applicable.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" 
        date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store listing 
        or your preferred method of contact.
