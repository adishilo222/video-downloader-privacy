# Icons Required

This folder must contain three icon files before packaging your extension:

## Required Files

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Format Requirements

- **Format**: PNG
- **Color mode**: RGB
- **Transparency**: Supported (optional)
- **File size**: Keep under 100KB each (recommended)

## Design Tips

1. **Simplicity**: Icons should be recognizable at small sizes (16x16)
2. **Contrast**: Ensure icons are visible on both light and dark backgrounds
3. **Consistency**: All three sizes should look similar (just scaled)
4. **Branding**: Consider using your extension's color scheme
5. **Clarity**: Avoid fine details that won't show at small sizes
